# Blackjack Game

## Rules

1. The goal of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, without exceeding 21.
2. Each player is dealt two cards initially, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
3. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.
4. Players can request additional cards (hit) to increase their hand value, or they can choose to stand and keep their current hand value.
5. If a player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
6. After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
7. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
8. If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and all remaining players win.
9. If the dealer's hand value is higher than a player's hand value without exceeding 21, the player loses.
10. If a player's hand value is higher than the dealer's hand value without exceeding 21, the player wins.
11. If a player's hand value is the same as the dealer's hand value, it is a tie (push) and the player neither wins nor loses.
